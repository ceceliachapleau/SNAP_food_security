#I used Current Population Survey Food Supplement to assess the trendings in food stamp use and food security in Michigan and Indiana from 2010 to 2021. There were many federal changes to food stamp policies during the Covid-19 pandemic. States also implement different food stamp policies. The pandemic offered an opportunity to explore if differences between states are significant.
